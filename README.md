# Lucid Protocol Specification

This repository contains the source information for the Lucid Protocol.

The protocol can be fully implemented using the information in this repository.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Normally the Lucid Protocol version number would advance by one whenever a group of code breaking changes are made. At the moment there are a number of large projects underway which may cause multiple breaking changes to the protocol code. To prevent the version number running away, we will stay fixed on version 3 with documentary changes accompanying code changes at incremental document versions e.g. 3.1, 3.2. Please use document version and git revision to explicitly reference a version in the meantime. We will stop this practice and revert to normal as soon as possible, moving to version 4 and removing this note when we do so.
